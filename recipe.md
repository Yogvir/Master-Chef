Save 1-2 outer leaves and place in a bag in the fridge (you will use these later).
Cut the Napa cabbage into 1-inch cubes.
Place napa cabbage in a bowl and toss with 1/4 cup sea salt.
Fill the bowl with filtered water and stir, and soak cabbage for 6-8 hours.
Place plate over the napa cabbage to keep it submerged.
After 6- 8 hours, drain (making sure to save the brine) and rinse, pressing the liquid out.
Peel and cut the daikon radish (or carrot)  into match sticks, about 2-3 inches long. Cut the scallions.
Place the drained cabbage along with the daikon, scallions and chili paste into the bowl. Massage a bit with gloved hands.
This is a very mild version shown below, so not very red, ( 2 tablespoons chili flakes).
You can also add more chili flakes if you want it spicier â€“ I normally add 4-6 tablespoons.
Cover with the cabbage leaf you saved, and press down. The leaf will help keep the cabbage submerged.
